# Brilliant CMake

### A CMake project template

Supports building a C++ project as an executable, library binary, or header only library.

A target is added to build a test executable using the Google Test framework. The test target is the name of the project suffixed with "_TEST", eg: MyProject_TEST. Tests are automatically discovered by ctest.
